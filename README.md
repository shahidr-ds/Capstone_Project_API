# SpaceX Launch Data Analysis and Prediction Project

This repository contains the full workflow and code used in the Coursera SpaceX Capstone Project. It includes data collection, processing, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

Each Jupyter Notebook corresponds to a different phase of the project:

### 1. SpaceX\_API\_Calls.ipynb

* Uses SpaceX REST APIs to retrieve launch data
* Includes response parsing and saving to CSV

### 2. Web\_Scraping.ipynb

* Scrapes additional SpaceX data from online sources
* Merges scraped data with API data

### 3. Data\_Wrangling.ipynb

* Cleans and transforms the collected data
* Handles missing values and ensures consistency

### 4. EDA\_SQL.ipynb

* Performs SQL-based exploratory data analysis
* Includes queries and result interpretation

### 5. Folium\_Maps.ipynb

* Creates interactive maps using Folium
* Displays launch site locations and outcomes

### 6. Plotly\_Dash.ipynb

* Builds interactive dashboards for visual analysis
* Includes filters, sliders, and summary plots

### 7. Classification\_Model.ipynb

* Develops and evaluates classification models
* Compares Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN
* Displays confusion matrix and model accuracy

## How to Use

Open each notebook in order to follow the full project pipeline:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the notebooks one by one or explore individual analyses

## Results Summary

* Visualized launch data using SQL, Folium, and Dash
* Interactive dashboard for launch outcomes and payload analysis
* Decision Tree had the highest accuracy (94.44%) in predicting success
